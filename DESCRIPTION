Description: survClust is an outcome weighted integrative clustering algorithm used to classify multi-omic samples on their available time to event information. The resulting clusters are cross-validated to avoid over overfitting and output classification of samples that are molecularly distinct and clinically meaningful. It takes in binary (mutation) as well as continuous data (other omic types).
